Cerulean for Wordpress
==================
This code was previously called Jade for Wordpress but has since been rebased and rebranded to match Cerulean. Cerulean for Wordpress is a theme that's based on the [Cerulean for Ghost](https://github.com/boumannm/cerulean-for-ghost) theme. For a quick look at the features you can check out the [Theme's project page](http://michaelboumann.info/collection/#ceruleanwp) or look at the 'quick and dirty' featurelist below.

# Recommmendation
Install Disqus or a other third party comments platform. The default commentsection is pretty much unstyled at this point (as i don't use it myself).
