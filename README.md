- Successfully validated HTML(5) using both [html5.Validator.nu](http://html5.validator.nu) and the [W3 HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/)

#Status
Currently under development. Master branch at least has a working version, and sometimes i tag 'releases' if i believe they are usable (aka more 'stable').
