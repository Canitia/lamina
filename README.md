jade (for Wordpress)
==================
This is the Wordpress version of the [jade](https://github.com/hxkclan/jade) theme for Ghost. 

#Current features
- Optimised for Phones, tablets and desktops
- Sidebar support (only shows it when on medium or higher resolutions)
- Change color and fonts of header
- Fairly easily change overall accent colors (top of CSS)
- Material Design inspired;
- Other stuff Wordpress can do ('custom' pages, 'custom' tag page, 'custom' category pages)

#Status
Currently under development. Sometimes i tag 'releases' if i believe they are usable (aka 'stable'). 

## Note
Wordpress default comments are currently unstyled so i recommend using third party ones for now. 

#Preview
