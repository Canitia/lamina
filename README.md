Cerulean for Wordpress
==================
This code was previously called Jade for Wordpress but has since been rebranded to match Cerulean. Cerulean for Wordpress is a theme that's based on the [Cerulean for Ghost](https://github.com/boumannm/cerulean-for-ghost) theme although it has gone quite it's own way in multiple ways now. For a quick look at the features you can check out the [Theme's project page](http://michaelboumann.info/collection/#ceruleanwp) or look at the 'quick and dirty' featurelist below.
