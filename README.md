jade (for Wordpress)
==================
This is the Wordpress version of the [jade](https://github.com/boumannm/jade) theme for Ghost.

**Oktober 2016 update**
The theme's demo page is down and will stay down for now. Check out screenshot.png to get an idea of what things will look like ;)

#Current features
- Optimised for Phones, tablets and desktops
- Sidebar support (only shows it when on medium or higher resolutions)
- Change color and fonts of header
- Fairly easily change overall accent colors (top of CSS)
- Material Design inspired;
- Other stuff Wordpress can do ('custom' pages, 'custom' tag page, 'custom' category pages)

#Status
Slowly working on it when i have time

## Note
Wordpress default comments are currently unstyled so i recommend using third party ones for now.
