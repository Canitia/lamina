Canitia
==================
Canitia is a Wordpress theme based on the [Canitia Jr.](https://github.com/boumannm/canitia-jr) theme. Although it has gone it's own way recently adding more features than it's Canitia Jr. counterpart. Which is one of the reasons i rebranded the Wordpress version to Canitia 'senior'. It now has it's own seperate entity. For a quick look at the features you can check out the [Theme's project page](http://michaelboumann.info/collection/#canitiawp) or look at the 'quick and dirty' featurelist below.
