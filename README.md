jade (for Wordpress)
==================
This is the Wordpress version of the [jade](https://github.com/hxkclan/jade) theme for Ghost. 

#Current features
- Has scale properties in CSS (<=576, <=720 and >720 resolutions);
- Bootstrap-based;
- Material Design inspired;
- Can do all the regular Wordpress stuff like set own header title, show user (that posted) and edit links on post pages, reply to posts etc.

#Status
Currently under (heavy) development. Master branch at least has a working version, and sometimes i tag 'releases' if i believe they are usable (aka more 'stable').
