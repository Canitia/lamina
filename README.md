jade (for Wordpress)
==================
This is the Wordpress version of the [jade](https://github.com/boumannm/jade) theme for Ghost.

**November 2016 update**
The theme's project page is back up and has moved [here](http://michaelboumann.info/collection/#jadewp).

# Current features
- Optimised for Phones, tablets and desktops
- Sidebar support (only shows it when on medium or higher resolutions)
- Change color and fonts of header
- Material Design inspired;
- Other stuff Wordpress can do ('custom' pages, 'custom' tag page, 'custom' category pages)

# Status
Tired but still working on it

# Note
Wordpress default comments are currently unstyled so i recommend using third party ones for now.
